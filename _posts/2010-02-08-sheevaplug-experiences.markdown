A bit of my history around Ruby and C++, and my future could be Elixir?

### Ruby
I donâ€™t want to be rational here. I just fell in love with Elixir. I had the same feeling with Ruby at first. I created a website with Rails and enjoyed how much nicer and easier was compared to the older methods. Then my love disappeared when I tried this in a very different scenario. I started writing a distributed filesystem in Ruby for my own entertainment. I worked full time on a distributed filesystem in my pro life and wanted to try a more enjoyable alternative.
