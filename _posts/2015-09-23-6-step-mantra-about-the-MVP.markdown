For me MVP is part of the startup business strategy rather than a pure technical issue. That is we know a very specific problem that a set of customers have, who are willing to pay an expected amount of money for this solution. Part of the business strategy is that we also know how to reach these customers. For instance I can do a Linkedin search and find customers with at least 5% chance them become paying customers.

This is the theory at least.

In this ideal world we only need to figure how we can test our assumptions with minimal programming efforts. This is what I call MVP.

If we don't know **who are our ideal customers** or **how to reach them** then we won't be able to test the business assumptions. Or if the **price is too high** then again we scare away customers without even talking to us.

### 1. MVP's role

If we listen, MVP may allow us to realize that we didn't know too much about our customers or the right price.

The other less lucky outcome of our MVP experiment is that we start tweaking the MVP by making it a Xmas tree of features thinking that we didn't have enough to attract customers. This may succeed if we happen to bump into a popular feature and our marketing efforts fill the information gap about our ideal customers. Plus our pricing was not prohibitively high.

If we agree on the theory why would we want to develop an MVP without enough information?

### 2. Have a great technical idea

Software developers are creative folks. We are usually full of new ideas that we think should be successful on the market because they just sound great. We only need to hire marketers and sales and they will take care of the rest.

It is not easy to accept that the world works differently. If we want to sell, customers come first, channels to access them the second and may be ideas at third if not later.

### 3. Free software

There are examples when technical ideas found their customers automatically. Most of them come from the Open Source world and they are sold for free.

People like free software and we may be lucky to find early adopters. What makes this challanging is to convert the non-paying user base to paying customers. The good news is that we may be in a better position, because we don't need to work that much to reach these prospects.

### 4. Looking at other technical ideas

Very often we (software developers) look at successful technical solutions and think they are just crap. We could do better because of the lack of capability X or missing feature Y, etc. Than we hear that this pile of thing has received N million money from venture capital.

This may be a point when we might start wondering why don't we quit our job and do a product that is as good, if not better than the one we looked at and spend our retirement on a sunny remote island having coctail on the beach.

Let me remind you my, software developer pal: this may come true only if you know your customers, know how to reach them and has a good pricing/business model.

### 5. Showing maturity

When we decided to do a startup we feel the urgency of creating our demoable product because we think this will attract customers and more importantly will put us in a different basket in the eyes of the Venture Capital.

Software development was a black art for long until agile methodologies came out. These days creating a software is quite predictable if we compare that to other startup activities. Like finding customers.

For instance if our ideal customer profile is the elvish speaking five legged dog, then we can develop quite a huge software system until we find one customer.

There is a huge temptation to write software too early. I suggest to resist and think more about customers and how to reach them.

### 6. Success defines MVP

Blaming game. When we are successful no one questions if our MVP is actually an MVP, although it may fail to be the Minimum of the potantial Viable Products. On the other hand, when customers don't come the first one to blame is usually the product.

This blame much likely to come to the software development team because we are the fathers of the (non-) MVP.
