### Interesting beast
System V semaphores are here for decades. Few days ago when I was looking for options for inter process communication I bumped into it again. Fortunately enough I picked up [Stevens' Unix Network Programming Vol #2](http://www.kohala.com/start/unpv22e/unpv22e.html) from the bookshelf rather then relying on a search engine. Stevens does a great job explaining what day are and what is their API and this explanation is badly needed.

I am not going to write about what is a semaphore. Search engines and Wikipedia are great resources on that. I will focus on this specific instrument.

If you are looking for a conventional semaphore functionality than System V semaphores are just bad:
 - the number of semaphores in the system is limited
 - the semaphore naming is ridicolous




### Simple counter

### Counter with overflow
