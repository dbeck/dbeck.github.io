Every time I hear that, this and that company came up with a new IoT standard I feel a shiver in my back. There are variations when single or multiple ones hide themselves behind a so called non-profit organization. There seems to be a whole lot of different companies trying to take advantage which has a few aspects I don't like.

1. manufacturers want to sell new devices even if most houses are already packed with intelligent devices
2. telecom companies are trying to bind users to their services
3. consultancy firms want to sell integration but at the same time trying to influence standards to fit their business needs
4. startups cover a few selected segments of making IoT a system because of limited resources

I feel that the participants in this game either reluctant or not able to see the IoT landscape as a convergent system. 

### Intelligent devices at home
Let's take a look around a typical networked home. Here is a list of devices I expect to see:

* Wireless router
* Network attached storage
* Media box
* Smart TV
* Raspberry PI or similar
* Tablet
* Smart phones
* PCs and Laptops

These are fairly strong computers that could be used for controlling dumb sensors. Some of these may have means to extend their functionality. The problem is that all are different.

### Saving on the investment
Me as a consumer would like to cut costs and make sure my existing smart devices would participate in my IoT game. The question is who is going to solve this?

As it stands not many from the current IoT players would be interested in this. Some want to sell hardware, others want to see constant revenue streams from me, etc...

I am not saying that I am unwilling to pay for my IoT system. I only say that I am not interested in partial solutions, neither want to throw away my thingies every second year.

### A new ecosystem is needed
Let's imagine that a technical solution exists for buying and downloading apps from an app store to run on my intelligent devices. Let's also imagine that this solution helps in controlling the devices, schedule maintenance, upgrades and on top of all these is secure.

The app store would act as a hub for dispatching applications from the creators and flow back the money from the end users. Apps could be created by hardware vendors to make their gadgets appealing and also hackers who would like to make money with midnight projects.

From this point on the feasibility of standards and protocols invented by groups of companies only depends on end user acceptance and the critical mass of application contributors. If a protocol or framework is not viable than it will die.

Everyone would benefit from this model. The same way as Linux has drivers for virtually anything and the same way as Android market place covers all possible user needs, this IoT app market would eventually cover all hardwares and devices under the sun.

### The technical solution
I believe Google Portable Native Client has a solution for running code in a secure environment in a portable way. It is efficient and resource friendly thus it would have acceptable performance on slower devices too. 

There are few things missing, but I believe this is not rocket science:

* the code that manages these native codes (download, start, stop, schecdule, etc...)
* definition of how these apps interact with the environment
* management of security settings
* app market

### Other options
Android apps already solved this for the mobile phones and tablets. There is also a huge variety of devices, may be not as big as for IoT. I still don't think Android is the way to go because:

* it is too heavy for many devices
* the app runner framework may need to coexist with the original software supplied by the intelligent device

### More business opportunities
There is obviously a business opportunity for the one who makes the app market and also for the app contributors. I believe this model would also allow other (or the same) players to create online services to:

* gather and analyze data from the devices
* control devices remotely
* provide services based on these apps
