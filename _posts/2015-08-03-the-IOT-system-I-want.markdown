I have mixed feelings when I hear the term IoT. Partly because as a developer and startupper I have a viewpoint of IoT than I have when I am a customer. My developer part is more like a hacker with interest all the devices around me. The consumer part don't really want to spend time with these thingies only benefit from them. The startupper wants to do business.

In this post I will give a bit of my IoT hacking history and write about my present.

### Linksys router

It was more than 10 years ago. Someone in the neighborhood has hacked my Linksys WRT54G router. My bandwidth was not so high so it was easy to notice the slowdown. I did a bit of research and realized that I can replace the firmware with a custom Tomato one. This was a very easy move, but in my case this broke a mental barrier.
